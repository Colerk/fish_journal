# Fish Journal

This was my very first project, which I used to teach myself Python & Django. It worked out great as it was an app that I wanted for my own use but was also a great teaching tool.

After login, users can record a history of their catch including: size, species, location, date, and method. Pins will be dropped in the map to record what locations you have had success, and show what you caught there. You will also see a history of your records as well as some stats showing your records.
